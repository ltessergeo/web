# PyWR_TheriakD

[![R build status](https://github.com/ShanaScogin/BayesPostEst/workflows/R-CMD-check/badge.svg)](https://github.com/ShanaScogin/BayesPostEst/actions)

As one of my two research agendas involves improving the tools we use to study petrology, a good deal of my time is spent using isochemical sections to understand equilibrium vs desequilibrium in natural metamorphic samples. Sometimes is tedious and repetitive to convert bulk rock composition in order to set as input parameter in modelling programs.

Below you'll find a simple Python script for a convenient conversion of x-ray fluorescence geochemical analysis to atomic prop to set as input in Theriak-Domino. I've been written this code to save time on tasks that I find myself doing over and over again.

I've collected convenience functions that I've written to address issues I frequently confront in my work into a personal R package called [RWmisc](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=RWmisc). It includes functions for:

- Managing multiple different projections for cross-national spatial data
- Converting latitude-longitude data in archaic forms (degrees, minutes, seconds)
- Correcting for overlapping polygons when aggregating raster data to polygons
- My custom minimal ggplot2 theme

# Other resources

I also have a number of other software resources focused on making computation and academic life easier:

- [The template](https://github.com/jayrobwilliams/JobMarket) I use for my academic job market materials
    - Fill in school/position information in one file and it populates to all statements
    - Generate summary statistics from teaching evaluations and integrate into statements
    - Combine multiple teaching evaluations into a single portfolio document
    - Do all of this programmatically with GNU Make!
- [The template](https://github.com/jayrobwilliams/UNC-Dissertation-Template) I used for my dissertation
    - This satisfied the formatting requirements at UNC in 2019
    - Some tweaking likely required to use at another institution or in the future
- [Scripts](https://github.com/jayrobwilliams/Teaching) that I use to save time on various teaching-related tasks like grading
- [Functions](https://github.com/jayrobwilliams/ComputerVision) for extracting still frames from videos and information from images in Python using OpenCV
- [Compiling OpenCV](/files/html/OpenCV_Install.html) from source for Anaconda virtual environments instead of Homebrew ones or system Python installations
