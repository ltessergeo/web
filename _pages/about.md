I am a PhD student at University of São Paulo (Brazil) with research collaboration at University of Lausanne (Switzerland).
I hold a B.S. from Federal Rural University of Rio de Janeiro (2018) and an M.S. from University of São Paulo (2021) both with emphasys in metamorphic petrology and tectonics. My master's dissertation can be found [here](https://www.teses.usp.br/teses/disponiveis/44/44143/tde-07062021-083043/en.php). 
In 2021 I received the FAPESP Scholarship to pursue my PhD.
Currently, I am doing an internship at University of Lausanne under supervision of [Pierre Lanari](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=WmXpZO4AAAAJ&hl=pt-PT&oi=ao); 
Our current research interests include major and trace element geospeedometry in garnet, barrovian metamorphism, and petrochronology.
