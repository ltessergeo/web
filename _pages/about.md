I am a PhD student at University of São Paulo (Brazil) with research collaboration at University of Lausanne (Switzerland).
I hold a B.S. from Federal Rural University of Rio de Janeiro (2018) and an M.S. from University of São Paulo (2021) both with emphasys in metamorphic petrology and tectonics under supervision of [Carlos Ganade](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=OhTnB9cAAAAJ&hl=pt-PT&oi=ao){:target="_blank"} and [Miguel Basei](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=0ASHXOwAAAAJ&hl=pt-PT&oi=ao){:target="_blank"}.

In 2021 I received the FAPESP Scholarship to pursue my PhD.
Currently, I am doing an internship at University of Lausanne under supervision of [Pierre Lanari](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=WmXpZO4AAAAJ&hl=pt-PT&oi=ao){:target="_blank"}; 

Our current research interests include major and trace element geospeedometry in garnet, barrovian metamorphism, and petrochronology.
